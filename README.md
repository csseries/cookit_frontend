# cookit_frontend

This is the Streamlit frontend app for [cookit](https://github.com/csseries/cookit). A user may upload an image of certain food ingredients and a Deep Learning Model will apply object-detection to predict a list of ingredients which are found on the image. The user can than edit and extend ingredients to find recipes which make the most of available ingredients.

The app is running on https://cookit-frontend.herokuapp.com/
